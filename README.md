# Creating User Accounts Using a Python Script

###

Description Section
In this lab, we explore automating user creation on a Linux system by implementing a Python script. This script reads user information from an input file and creates multiple users and groups on the system accordingly.

Operation Section
Step 1 - Create a GitHub Repository for Script Source Control

Create a new GitHub repository named inet_4031_adduser_script.
Sync this repository with a local repository.
Step 2 - Create a file named 'create-users.py'

Follow the provided instructions to create the Python script file.
Ensure correct formatting and Python version compatibility.
Step 3 - Create the 'create-users.input' file

Create an input text file that contains user configuration details.
Each line defines a user with fields separated by colons.
Step 4 - Create users with the 'create-users.py' script

Run the script with elevated privileges using either of the provided commands.
Answer the question regarding the purpose of the < and | symbols.
Step 5 - Confirm the users have been created

Confirm user existence and group memberships in /etc/passwd and /etc/group.
Step 6 - Sync Everything With GitHub

Push the Python code and input file to the GitHub repository.
Include a screenshot demonstrating the successful addition of users.
Step 7 - Create a Helpful and Professionally formatted GitHub README

Ensure the README.md file is well-formatted and provides clear instructions on how to run the code.
